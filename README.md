# go-plugin
How to use Golang [plugin](https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/) 


## Note
On mac with go version 1.8, error occurs `-buildmode=plugin not supported on darwin/amd64` 
after building.
So it's needed to build and run on lunux environment.


## Installation
```
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up

$ make bcin
 or
$ make exec 
```
